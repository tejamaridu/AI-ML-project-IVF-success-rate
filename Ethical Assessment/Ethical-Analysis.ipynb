    "\n",
    "## A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The dataset consist of actual human embryo images.The data is publicly available to everyone in the form of an image dataset, and it is used only for experimental purposes. It contains the images of an embryo(blastocyst) and the components, for which we need to find the confidence percentage, area, radius, and thickness to identify whether it is the right embryo to transfer or not. There is no information provided about the details of patients, whose embryo images are taken at PCRM by using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope during the years between 2012 and 2016.**\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " \n",
    "**Yes the dataset is approved by the Canadian Research Ethics Board on 24 May 2017. Therefor we believe that the they would have considered data collection bias while collecting the data.**\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "**There is no personally identifiable information in the dataset.The images of embryo does not reveal any personal information such as the name of the person or any details of the person who provided the embryo image.**\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Since we are using globally available dataset any one can use the dataset for the research perpose. Only people who have given authorities by SFU Vault can modefy the dataset and the dataset is secured in SFU Vault.**\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " \n",
    "**We can contact  SFU Vault or the Publisher if anyone wants to delete their data.**\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "**We have contacted the SFU Vault for the Publisher details waiting for the response. As of now there is no information on plan to delete the dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## C. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The dataset is collected with the guidence of a domain expert (embryologist)as per the IEEE paper \"Cell-Net: Embryonic Cell Counting and Centroid Localization via Residual Incremental Atrous Pyramid and Progressive Upsampling Convolution\", which was published by the same publisher of that of the dataset.**\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**As the dataset is approved by the Canadian Research Ethics Board on 24 May 2017. Therefor we believe that the they would have considered dataset bias while collecting the data.**\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes, the data collected is for research perpose so, the reports are designed to honestly represent the underlying data.**\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The data is safeguarded in a vault at Simon Fraser University, but it is publicly available to everyone for experimental purposes. There is no personal information about the details of patients available for this dataset. This image dataset is using only to detect the embryos for improving the in-vitro fertilization success rate.**\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## D. Modeling\n",
    "**We have not reached the modeling stage**\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate bias**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "## E. Deployment\n",
    "**We have not reached the Deployment stage**\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Concept drift**: Do we test and monitor for concept drift to ensure the model remains fair over time?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
